**AbsBox** is a python based library which pertains to structured product analytics. 

* By adopting `Data-Driven` way to build cashflow models, it's easy to pull factual data from database/local files to build cashflow models.
* By adopting using resuable components, it flattens the learning curve to build cashflow models in ABS/MBS space.
* Being capable of modeling deal via a natureal & structural language way.

    - designed to perform investment analytics 
  
      - setting pool/loan level assumptions: default, prepayment, loss, (revolving assupmtions)
      - setting deal level assumptions: trigger, call, interest rate curve
      - view the projected pool and bond cashflow , pricing the cashflow to get IRR / WAL / Duration and PV
    - or structuring ( pool selection/waterfall design/bond pricing) by 
  
      - swaping different pool/liability plans 
      - to view the projected pool and bond cashflow from these plan 
      - pick the best plan  
    - using ``RESTful`` service, easy to integration (Docker is ready)
